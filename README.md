## âš™ About

- It compresses and decompresses .txt files using Huffman Coding technique .
- Huffman coding (also known as Huffman Encoding) is an algorithm for doing data compression, and it forms the basic idea behind file compression. This post talks about the fixed-length and variable-length encoding, uniquely decodable codes, prefix rules, and Huffman Tree construction.
- Compression ratio usually improves as the file size increases.
- WebApp is made responsive (with HTML and CSS ) and interactive (with JavaScript ) .
- It can also be downloaded locally as it is provided with feature of progressive web app.
- An Info page is added to give more information about Huffman coding.
